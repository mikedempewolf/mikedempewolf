- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikedempewolf
- 👀 I’m interested in software development.  I am passionate about good design, best practices, and good softare engineering principles.  I like to share my knowledge through teaching or through collaboration.  I have worked in the software industry for over 25 years.  I was a professor of compueter science at Clarke University for 5 years.  I moved back to development in the field because I love the challenge of building things to provide value to users and organizations.  I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and a Masters and Ph.D. in Information Technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Amazon Web Services - specifically App Mesh, Elastic Container Services, Faraget with Docker, and Code Deploy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything with full stack development, augmented reality, virtual reality.
